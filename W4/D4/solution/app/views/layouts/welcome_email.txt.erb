  "Did you know that just because someone has a lot of cats doesn't make them crazy? I'm glad you're here. Welcome to the club. We get discounts at the local PetsMart, CostCo, WholeFoods, and the bowling alley has Caturday Saturdays because the owner, Belinda, is one of us. One of us. Worth noting, don't stare at the hooded figures in the park next to the bowling alley. Don't think about the hooded figures in the park next to the bowling alley. Don't think about hooded figures. Don't think about the park. Don't think about the bowling alley. Caturday Saturdays start at 5pm. Can't wait to see you!"
